If multiplicity survives how should we quantify the welfare implications of choosing one of these delegation schemes ? Can any of these schemes affect the likelihood that economic agents successfully coordinate on the best equilibrium ? To address these questions we study a version of the familiar sticky price model modified to incorporate capital accumulation Sveen and Weinke   Woodford   This model contains all the features as at the heart of many DSGE models used in policy analysis which makes it a representative agent for our policy analysis Moreover we choose a set up which encompasses the worst case scenario : there are expectation traps and economic agents may be more likely to coordinate on the worst equilibrium Dennis and Kirsanova   We confirm the previous results that all these delegation schemes can improve social welfare but we show that they only unequivocally improve welfare if the economy remains in the best equilibrium At the same time we demonstrate that none of the considered delegation schemes eliminates expectation traps moreover new equilibria arise under delegation Whether there is a gain associated with a transition to a delegation scheme will depend on which equilibrium under the original unmodified objective one starts from and to which equilibrium one transitions More encouragingly all delegation schemes reduce the range of parameters which ensure the unique worst equilibrium thus increasing the likelihood of coordinating on the Paretopreferred equilibrium We also argue that a delegation scheme can change the way how agents coordinate on an equilibrium In particular we show that price level targeting increases the likelihood that the best equilibrium realizes The paper is organized as follows In the next section we outline the model and discuss the calibration Section   recapitulates the analysis in Blake and Kirsanova   for our stickyprice model with capital showing how multiplicity arises when monetary policy is conducted under discretion and with an unmodified monetary policy objective	1
